    question: "What is a courier service?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A courier service is a professional delivery solution that transports
        parcels, documents, or goods from one location to another, both
        domestically and internationally. These services ensure safe, fast, and
        reliable shipping, often providing tracking, insurance, and customer
        support. Most couriers operate with their own network and logistics
        system, allowing for door-to-door delivery and pickup options. Using a
        courier helps individuals and businesses send important items securely,
        efficiently, and with peace of mind.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How can I book a parcel?",
    answer: (
      <>
        You can book a parcel by visiting the courier’s website, using their
        mobile app, or physically going to a local branch/office. The process
        usually involves entering the sender and receiver details, selecting the
        type of service (standard, express, etc.), specifying the parcel size
        and weight, and choosing payment options. Many couriers also offer
        on-demand pickup, making it convenient to send parcels directly from
        your home or office.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How do I track my package?",
    answer: (
      <>
        After booking your parcel, you’ll receive a tracking number. Enter this
        number on the courier’s website or app to view real-time updates about
        your package’s location and delivery status. Tracking systems provide
        information such as pickup confirmation, transit checkpoints, expected
        delivery date, and final delivery confirmation. It’s an essential way to
        stay informed and quickly address any delivery issues.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How are courier charges determined?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Courier charges depend on several factors: the weight and size of the
        package, the distance between sender and receiver, the type of service
        (express, standard, overnight), and any additional features like
        insurance or special handling. Most couriers offer a rate calculator
        online so you can estimate costs before booking. International
        deliveries may also include customs charges or import/export fees.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I send parcels internationally?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, many courier services offer international delivery to countries
        around the world. You’ll need to provide accurate customs information
        and check for any restrictions on prohibited items. International
        courier services may require additional documents, and delivery times
        will vary depending on destination and customs clearance processes.
        Always check the courier’s guidelines for international shipments before
        booking.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How long does delivery take?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Delivery time depends on the destination, service type, and courier
        company. For local shipments, delivery can take 1–2 business days; for
        national deliveries, typically 2–5 days. Express or same-day services
        may be available for urgent parcels. International shipping times vary,
        usually between 3–10 business days, depending on customs and transit
        routes. You can check estimated delivery times during the booking
        process.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What items are prohibited in courier?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Couriers generally prohibit the shipment of illegal items, explosives,
        flammable substances, firearms, drugs, perishable foods, live animals,
        and other items restricted by law. Some couriers may have additional
        restrictions on liquids, fragile goods, or high-value items. Always
        review the courier’s prohibited item list or contact customer service
        before sending anything you’re unsure about.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How will I know when my package is delivered?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Once your package is delivered, most courier services will notify you
        via SMS, email, or app notification. You can also check the delivery
        confirmation using your tracking number. Some couriers provide proof of
        delivery, such as receiver’s signature or photo, for added security. If
        you don’t receive a notification, you can contact customer support for
        confirmation.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What if my package is lost?",
    answer: (
      <>
        If your package is lost in transit, contact the courier’s customer
        support immediately with your tracking number and shipment details. Most
        couriers have a claims process for lost items, which may include
        investigation and compensation if the parcel is insured. Keep your
        booking and payment records, and file your claim as soon as possible for
        quick resolution.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How can I pay for courier service?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Payment options typically include cash at the branch, credit or debit
        card, mobile banking, online payment gateway, or cash on delivery (COD)
        if available. You’ll select your preferred payment method while booking.
        Some couriers also accept payment via mobile wallets or bank transfer
        for added convenience.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How safe is courier service?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Courier services are generally safe, especially if you choose a
        reputable company. Most offer package tracking, insurance options, and
        secure handling procedures. For valuable or fragile items, you can opt
        for extra insurance or special packaging. If you have concerns, review
        the courier’s policies or customer reviews before booking.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What are the office hours?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Courier office hours vary by location and company, but most operate from
        9 AM to 8 PM on weekdays. Some branches may be open on weekends or offer
        extended hours, especially for express services. Check your local
        branch’s schedule on the courier’s website or by calling customer
        support.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is Cash on Delivery (COD) available?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, Cash on Delivery is available with many courier services. This
        allows the receiver to pay for the parcel upon receipt. COD is popular
        for e-commerce deliveries and business transactions. You can select COD
        while booking if the service is available for your destination.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an ID for courier service?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Some courier services require you to provide a valid ID, national ID
        card, or phone number for booking and delivery, especially for
        high-value or sensitive parcels. This helps with identification and
        ensures secure delivery. Always carry your ID when visiting a branch or
        receiving a package.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I send liquids or food items?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Certain couriers allow shipment of liquids or food items, but specific
        rules and packaging requirements apply. Foods must be non-perishable and
        securely packed; liquids should be sealed and labeled. Check with your
        courier about their policies before sending such items, and avoid
        prohibited or hazardous substances.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if delivery fails?",
    answer: (
      <>
        If delivery fails (e.g., receiver not available, wrong address),
        couriers usually attempt delivery again, notify the sender, or return
        the package to the sender. Charges may apply for repeated delivery
        attempts or returns. Always provide accurate receiver information and
        keep your phone available for delivery updates.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Can I send gifts through courier?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, you can send gifts, parcels, and documents through courier
        services. Be sure to pack gifts securely, include a receiver’s address
        and phone number, and declare the contents if required. Some couriers
        offer special gift packaging or greeting card options for festive
        deliveries.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Is delivery available on Fridays or holidays?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Many courier services operate seven days a week, including Fridays and
        public holidays. However, delivery times may vary, and some services may
        have limited operations on holidays. Check with your courier or branch
        for their holiday schedule before booking urgent deliveries.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How much does courier charge?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Courier charges start from around 50 BDT for small parcels, increasing
        with weight, distance, and service type (express, standard,
        international). You can use online calculators or contact customer
        service for exact pricing before booking your shipment.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Why is phone number required for courier?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A phone number is required for communication, delivery confirmation, and
        notifications. It allows the courier to contact the sender or receiver
        in case of issues, address verification, or delivery updates. Providing
        an accurate phone number helps ensure timely and successful delivery.
